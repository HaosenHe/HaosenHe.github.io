Chen, Susanne Vogel, and Chu\nA.(Alex) Yu\nEcological Modelling. Volume 464, February 2022, 109852\nAbstract: This paper builds on the framework of\nutility maximization from economics with the theory of optimal foraging\nto bring an economic perspective to the issue of elephant crop\nconsumption. Using an agent-based model (ABM) in which elephant agents\nmaximize their energy balance subject to time and movement constraints,\nwe correctly predicted 56% of terrain blocks visited by elephant\ncrop-raiders in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique from December 2015\nto December 2016, which is a 25% improvement in performance compared\nwith two existing models. Findings from this ABM support ecological\nunderstanding of elephant crop foraging, highlighting the optimal\nmovements involved in crop foraging events as well as the importance of\ntrespassing costs and landscape configuration.\nWork in Progress\nModeling\nbehavioral response to infectious diseases under information delay\nwith Frederick H. Chen and Chu A.(Alex) Yu\nAbstract: We formulate and numerically solve a\ngame-theoretic model of rational agents’ self-protective actions in an\nepidemic game with information delay. We then compare our model\nsimulation results with data collected from real human players in an\nonline experiment conducted by Chen et al(2013). We find that, compared\nwith game-theoretic agents, human players receive poorer endgame\noutcomes due to a lack of synchronization in their self-protective\nactions. In addition, human players’ decisions are dependent on their\ninfection history, and they are less responsive to changes in disease\nprevalence compared to game-theoretic agents. Our results suggest that\nhuman players in the epidemic game differ substantially from\nfully-rational, forward-looking, strategic agents in terms of both\nplayer outcomes and decision-making mechanisms.\n\n\n\n",
