## Bio

Hi! I'm Haosen He, a senior at Wake Forest University studying Mathematics and Economics. I'm interested in Economic Modeling, Game Theory, and Causal Inference. Starting this June, I will be working as a Stanford Law Empirical Research Fellow (SLERF) at Stanford University.


## Publication

“An agent-based model of elephant crop consumption walks using combinatorial optimization” (first author)
with Erin Buchholtz, Frederick Chen, Susanne Vogel, and Alex Yu. ***Ecological Modelling*** (2022).\
<sub>This paper builds on the framework of utility maximization from economics with the theory of optimal foraging
to bring an economic perspective to the issue of elephant crop consumption. Using an agent-based model (ABM)
in which elephant agents maximize their energy balance subject to time and movement constraints, we correctly
predicted 56% of terrain blocks visited by elephant crop-raiders in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique from
December 2015 to December 2016, which is a 25% improvement in performance compared with two existing
models. Findings from this ABM support ecological understanding of elephant crop foraging, highlighting
the optimal movements involved in crop foraging events as well as the importance of trespassing costs and
landscape configuration.</sub>
