I was born in Jinan, Shandong, China (though it's not my actual hometown). The painting below depicts what Jinan looked like in around 1295 C.E. The place I grew up isn't far from that spiky mountain on the right. Today it is still a very spiky mountain, but it's now surrounded by high-rise buildings, and a railway runs underneath.
