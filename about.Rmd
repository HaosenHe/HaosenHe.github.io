I was born in Jinan, Shandong, China. The painting below ("Autumn Colors on the Que and Hua Mountains") depicts what Jinan looked like in around 1295 C.E. I like this painting and the artist a lot. Due to some historic reasons, the artist did not enjoy a good reputation. For similar reasons, I was never able to see this artwork in person. The place I grew up isn't far from that spiky mountain on the right. Today it is still a very spiky mountain, but it's now surrounded by high-rise buildings, and a railway runs underneath.
